Kenyan Chai Ingredient Calculator
This simple JavaScript application helps you determine the basic ingredients needed to brew a specific number of cups of authentic Kenyan chai. It's a quick way to scale your recipe directly in your web browser.

How It Works
The calculateChaiIngredients() function uses a standard recipe for one cup of chai and then dynamically calculates the total quantities required based on your desired number of cups.

Standard Recipe (per 1 cup):

Water: 200 ml

Milk: 50 ml

Tea Leaves (Majani): 1 tablespoon

Sugar (Sukari): 2 teaspoons

When the web page loads, a prompt will appear, asking you how many cups of chai you wish to make. After you enter a valid number, the function calculates the total amount for each ingredient and displays a clear list in your browser's developer console.

How to Use
To get your custom ingredient list:


Open in Browser: Open your .html file using any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

Enter Desired Cups: As soon as the page loads, a prompt dialog box will appear. Enter a positive number for the cups of chai you want to make (e.g., 4) and click "OK".

View Ingredients: Open your browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12 on Windows/Linux or Cmd + Option + J on Mac) and navigate to the "Console" tab. Your customized ingredient list will be displayed there.

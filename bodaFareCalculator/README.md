Boda Fare Calculator
This simple JavaScript application helps you estimate the fare for a boda boda (motorcycle taxi) ride based on the distance traveled. It's a straightforward tool for quick fare calculations directly in your web browser.

How It Works
The calculateBodaFare() function applies a basic fare structure to determine the cost of a ride:

Base Fare: A fixed initial charge (set at KES 50 in the code).

Charge per Kilometer: An additional cost for each kilometer traveled (set at KES 15 per kilometer).

When you open the web page, a prompt will appear, asking you for the trip distance in kilometers. After you enter the distance, the function calculates the estimated total fare, including a breakdown of the per-kilometer cost. All the details are then displayed in your browser's developer console.

How to Use
To use this fare estimator:


Open in Browser: Open your .html file using any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Enter Distance: As soon as the page loads, a prompt dialog box will appear. Enter the distance of your trip in kilometers (e.g., 5 for 5 km or 7.5 for 7.5 km) and click "OK".

View Results: Open your browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12 on Windows/Linux or Cmd + Option + J on Mac) and navigate to the "Console" tab. Your estimated fare details will be displayed there.

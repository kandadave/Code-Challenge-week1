**Boda Fare Calculator **

This simple JavaScript application helps you estimate the fare for a boda boda (motorcycle taxi) ride based on the distance traveled. It's a straightforward tool for quick fare calculations directly in your web browser.

How It Works The calculateBodaFare() function applies a basic fare structure to determine the cost of a ride:

Base Fare: A fixed initial charge (set at KES 50 in the code).

Charge per Kilometer: An additional cost for each kilometer traveled (set at KES 15 per kilometer).

When you open the web page, a prompt will appear, asking you for the trip distance in kilometers. After you enter the distance, the function calculates the estimated total fare, including a breakdown of the per-kilometer cost. All the details are then displayed in your browser's developer console.

How to Use To use this fare estimator:

Open in Browser: Open your .html file using any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Enter Distance: As soon as the page loads, a prompt dialog box will appear. Enter the distance of your trip in kilometers (e.g., 5 for 5 km or 7.5 for 7.5 km) and click "OK".

View Results: Open your browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12 on Windows/Linux or Cmd + Option + J on Mac) and navigate to the "Console" tab. Your estimated fare details will be displayed there.



**Kenyan Chai Ingredient Calculator**

This simple JavaScript application helps you determine the basic ingredients needed to brew a specific number of cups of authentic Kenyan chai. It's a quick way to scale your recipe directly in your web browser.

How It Works The calculateChaiIngredients() function uses a standard recipe for one cup of chai and then dynamically calculates the total quantities required based on your desired number of cups.

Standard Recipe (per 1 cup):

Water: 200 ml

Milk: 50 ml

Tea Leaves (Majani): 1 tablespoon

Sugar (Sukari): 2 teaspoons

When the web page loads, a prompt will appear, asking you how many cups of chai you wish to make. After you enter a valid number, the function calculates the total amount for each ingredient and displays a clear list in your browser's developer console.

How to Use To get your custom ingredient list:

Open in Browser: Open your .html file using any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

Enter Desired Cups: As soon as the page loads, a prompt dialog box will appear. Enter a positive number for the cups of chai you want to make (e.g., 4) and click "OK".

**Transaction Fee Estimator**

This simple JavaScript application helps you estimate the transaction fee for sending money, applying a specific percentage rate with defined minimum and maximum limits. It's designed for quick, on-the-fly calculations directly in your web browser.

How It Works The estimateTransactionFee() function calculates the fee based on the following rules:

Percentage Fee: A base rate of 1.5% of the amount you intend to send.

Minimum Fee: The fee will always be at least KES 10. If 1.5% of the amount is less than KES 10, it defaults to KES 10.

Maximum Fee: The fee will never exceed KES 70. If 1.5% of the amount is greater than KES 70, it caps at KES 70.

When the web page loads, a prompt will appear asking you for the amount you wish to send in Kenyan Shillings (KES). The function then calculates the applicable fee, sums it with your original amount to get the total debited amount, and displays all details in your browser's developer console.

How to Use To use this estimator:

Open in Browser: Open the saved .html file using any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

Enter Amount: As soon as the page loads, a prompt dialog box will appear. Enter the amount you wish to send (e.g., 500 for KES 500) and click "OK".

View Results: Open your browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12 on Windows/Linux or Cmd + Option + J on Mac) and navigate to the "Console" tab. The calculated transaction fee and total amount will be displayed there.
